# React CRUD application

Introduction

- This is a simple React CRUD application built using React hooks.

# Prerequisites

  - You'll need a basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/ES6.
  - You should also know the fundamentals of React, which you can learn by reading [Getting Started with React](https://www.taniarascia.com/getting-started-with-react/).

In this tutorial, we'll make a simple CRUD app. It will have users, and you'll be able to add, update, or delete users. We won't use any React classes, and instead we'll utilize State Hooks and Effect Hooks on functional components.

### Installation

React requires the latest [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) to run.

Download the latestr Node [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
>   Install npm after downloading and installing the node with below command

```sh
$ npm install
or
$ npm install -g npm@latest
```

### Create React App
We'll start by installing the project with create-react-app (CRA).
```sh
$ npx create-react-app react-crud-app
```

### Initial Setup
- Delete everything from the /src folder except App.js, index.js, and index.css.
- In index.js, we'll simplify it by removing the references to Service Workers.
